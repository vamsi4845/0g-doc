Welcome to the 0G Faucet â€“ your gateway to obtaining testnet tokens for the 0G network!

## What is the 0G Faucet?

The 0G Faucet provides free testnet tokens, essential for interacting with the 0G testnet. Whether you're running a node, utilizing our storage or data availability (DA) network, you'll need these tokens to test and explore the 0G environment without using real cryptocurrency.

## How to Get Testnet Tokens
- **Use the Faucet Website:** The easiest way to request tokens is through our [faucet website](https://faucet.0g.ai). Each user can receive up to 1 A0GI token per day, which is sufficient for most testing needs.
- **Request via thirdweb:** From [thirdweb faucet](https://thirdweb.com/0g-newton-testnet?utm_source=0g&utm_medium=docs), Each user can receive up to 0.01 A0GI token per day.
- **Request via Discord:** If you require more than 1 A0GI token per day, please reach out in our vibrant [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/0glabs) to request additional tokens.
