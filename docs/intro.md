## The First Decentralized AI Operating System (deAIOS)

**0G (Zero Gravity)** is the first decentralized AI [operating system](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) that acts as the foundational layer for decentralized AI applications and chains. It efficiently orchestrates utilization of hardware resources such as storage and compute and software assets such as data and models to handle the scale and complexity of AI workloads.

Specifically designed for AI (d)applications and chains, 0G features the fastest, infinitely scalable data availability (DA) layer, the cheapest decentralized storage system, and a novel flexible serving framework for inferences and fine-tuning. Prior to 0G, resource-intensive AI applications would only be feasible "off-chain" due to burdensome on-chain costs, low latency and throughput, and a lack of builder-friendly tooling.

For the first time ever, 0G bridges this cost and efficiency gap between Web2 and Web3, empowering builders to confidently deploy AI applications on-chain with _improved_ performance.

The 0G deAIOS has 4 key components: 
- **0G Chain**: The fastest, most modular blockchain, making on-chain gaming and AI a reality.
- **0G Storage Network**: A decentralized storage network optimized for massive data loads.
- **0G Compute Network**: A versatile framework for AI compute, including fast data retrieval, model inference/training, etc.
- **0G DA**: An infinitely scalable and programmable data availability layer designed for high-performance chains.

<summary> **What is decentralized storage?** </summary>

Decentralized storage distributes data across multiple network nodes rather than relying on a central server. This approach enhances data security, resilience, and accessibility by eliminating the single point of failure common in centralized systems.

**What is data availability?**
Data availability guarantees that data stored within the system is readily accessible and retrievable whenever required. 0G's data availability network employs erasure coding and a quorum-based attestation system to ensure data remains available even in scenarios where some nodes might fail.

**What is an AI compute network?**
An AI compute network is a system that facilitates the deployment and execution of AI models. 0G's decentralized compute network supports data retrieval, AI inference, and model training, ensuring efficient resource management for AI applications.

**What is a modular blockchain?**
A modular blockchain is one where each layer or component is specialized for a particular function, improving scalability and flexibility. 0G Chain uses this architecture to optimize its components, allowing for independent optimization of consensus, execution, and chain storage. This modular architecture enables each component to be fine-tuned for its specific requirements, resulting in enhanced performance, scalability, and flexibility for decentralized AI applications.

All of these network components utilize carefully designed and innovative sharding mechanisms to achieve infinite horizontal scalability, thereby removing obstacles to the true democratization of AI.

## 0G’s Namesake

“0G” gets its name from “Zero Gravity,” personifying the ultimate goal of achieving a state of weightlessness where transactions and data exchanges can occur effortlessly. Infrastructure should be customizable for developers and invisible to the end-user.

With 0G’s technology, the possibilities are endless. Previously infeasible use cases are now within reach, including:

- On-chain AI, including training large language models (LLMs)
- Storage of entire AI agent networks on-chain
- Storage of large datasets for data cleaning and labeling

And this is just the beginning.
