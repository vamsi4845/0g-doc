# Preface

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the course of human history. On the back of six decades of Moore's Law and three decades of the internet comprising all of human knowledge, [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/) scale at an unprecedented rate towards AGI - 
by some [accounts](https://situational-awareness.ai/from-gpt-4-to-agi/), arriving as soon as 2027. 

Limitless, abundant productivity and creativity brought by AGI will free humanity to pursue our highest potential. AGI is poised to contribute [trillions](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-economic-potential-of-generative-ai-the-next-productivity-frontier#key-insights) to the global economy annually, transform industries by driving the marginal cost of intelligence toward zero, and morph society by accompanying us as thought partner and companion. This global-scale change could uplift all of humanity. 

However, our current computing infrastructure is [insufficient](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand) to support the development of AGI, and even more alarming is that this immense power is concentrated in the [hands of a few](https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/10/consumers-are-voicing-concerns-about-ai). 

A global-scale technology revolution requires both a global-scale technological infrastructure and a global-scale alignment mechanism. A world AI infrastructure could leapfrog the confines of data centers and support exponential scaling towards AGI so that humanity could benefit from unlimited intelligence. A global-scale coordination and alignment mechanism ensures that the benefits of AI can be widely, fairly, and safely distributed.

## The First Decentralized  AI [Operating System](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) (deAIOS)
0G is building the global foundation for a better, fairer, and more open AI ecosystem, where power is distributed and innovation thrives. 

With 0G deAIOS, the **TOMA** (transparent, owned, monetized, and aligned) future for AGI is near:

- **Transparency**: Centralized AI systems operate as black boxes, with opaque decision-making processes and no clear data provenance. Users who provide training data rarely receive adequate rewards for their contributions, and the system lacks transparency in how value is distributed. _Decentralized AI fosters transparency by providing open, auditable decision-making processes and verifiable data sources, ensuring accountability at every step._ **0G‚Äôs modular architecture enables transparent data traceability and verifiable AI models, making every decision and data source traceable.**

- **Ownership**: Centralized AI platforms often sell or misuse personal data, with users having little control or ownership over how their information is collected, stored, or used. _Blockchain technology empowers users to retain control over their data, deciding how and when it‚Äôs used._ **With 0G, users can store and manage data on-chain through decentralized storage networks, retaining full ownership and control.**
  
- **Monetization**: Centralized AI systems often monopolize profits and leave little incentive for individual contributors. _Blockchain enables the issuance of rewards to incentivize participation and subsequently distribute rewards in a fair and transparent manner._ **Users of 0G‚Äôs storage, data availability, or serving platforms pay a small fee for these services, and these rewards are then distributed to the nodes.** 
  
- **Alignment**: Centralized AI systems lack oversight and governance processes. A select group may have the authority to censor or promote material, leading to misalignment with human values. _Decentralized AI platforms promote collective governance and oversight by increasing access to AI development, fostering inclusivity and innovation by a broader community rather than a single entity._ **0G provides access to lower-cost compute resources, lowering the high cost barrier to entry for inference, fine-tuning, and training.** 

As the first deAIOS, 0G brings together models, compute, and data on a single global platform, enabling developers to build AI applications that are more **PLG** (performant, limitless, and global) than ever before: 

- **Performant**: Currently, developers and researchers lack access to high-grade computing and storage resources, limiting their ability to advance at the cutting edge of AI development. _Decentralized GPU networks that run on blockchains provide high-performance compute resources pooled by the community and available to all._ **0G provides access to enterprise-grade compute resources, enabling developers to build AI applications that are more performant than ever before.** 

- **Limitless**: Currently, compute clusters and data sets are siloed and limited in scale. _Decentralized blockchain-based compute networks and data sources empower AI developers to scale their dapps beyond the confines of currently available compute and data._ **0G provides infinite scalability and access to compute resources and data from anywhere in the world.** 

- **Global**: Currently, only certain regions in the world provide the infrastructure needed to advance AI. _Decentralized AI platforms built on blockchain networks can democratize access to AI development._ **Users of 0G's global AI operating system can build AI applications that are accessible to everyone, everywhere.** 

In the following sections, we‚Äôll dive deeper into how 0G enables this vision and what it means for the future of AI.
