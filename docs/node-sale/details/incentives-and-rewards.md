## How can node buyers create a referral code?
Node buyers will be able to share their wallet address as the referral code after they made a purchase, it would give a 10% rebate to their referrals. 

## What rebate is available when using a referral code?
If you enter a referral code when purchasing a node, you'll receive a 10% rebate on the total price. 

## How will I receive my commission? (For Referrers)â€‹
You will be able to claim the commission of any successful node purchased through the node on the reward claim site, which will be available after the public sale. Please refer to the 0G X for access to the claim site closer to the sale date.

## Vesting Terms
Rewards from node operation vest over a three-year schedule, promoting consistent and long-term engagement. Vesting reduces the likelihood of short-term sales, fostering network stability and growth.

## Additional Community Incentives
Partnerships, 0G ecosystem communities, and referrals provide extra benefits, such as rebates or promotional whitelist access. All promotional activities adhere to [regulatory guidelines](https://0gfoundation.ai/disclaimer), and any reward or referral payments are conditional upon KYC eligibility.
