# Purchasing Nodes: Steps and Payment Options
**Supported Blockchains and Payment Methods**: The sale will be conducted in USDC on Arbitrum, but we provide a live bridging gateway at checkout that supports multiple blockchains (ETH, Arbitrum, BNB) and tokens. All purchases require a compatible wallet, and the resulting node licenses are issued as non-transferable ERC-721 NFTs.

Please note: Initially, the Public Sale was intended to use wETH on Arbitrum, but after the communityâ€™s feedback, it will be USDC on Arbitrum. Please note this correction to USDC on Arbitrum as the video says wETH.
