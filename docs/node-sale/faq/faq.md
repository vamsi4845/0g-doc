Node operations will commence after the mainnet launch, projected for Q1 2025. License holders will receive further instructions for operation and delegation options if preferred.
### How Do Rewards for Alignment Nodes Compare with Other Nodes?
Alignment Nodes are expected to offer higher reward rates due to their unique responsibilities, limited supply, and operational requirements compared to storage or validator nodes.
### Are Multiple NFTs Supported per Server?
Yes, users may operate multiple NFTs on a single server, with allowances for connecting and managing several nodes under one setup.

## Whitelist & Node Sale
### What is the whitelist (WL)?​
Whitelist is a pre-approved list of participants who are given exclusive access to certain privileges during a sale event. This system is used to reward and incentivize key contributors, partners, or early supporters of a project.

### Does entering the whitelist guarantee that I can definitely purchase a node?​
Your whitelist guarantees an allocation during the Whitelist sale period (starting Nov 11). If a purchase is not made within this period, your allocation will be released.

### How to join the whitelist?​
To get a whitelist spot for the 0G Foundation Node Sale, community members and ecosystem participants are eligible for allocations, please visit 0G X and Discord for ways to receive a whitelist. You can also apply for a whitelist spot by filling out the whitelist form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZSiIn3WBEdztzCObFBnLa0c6f1YoRwlN_eI8NxGPuG4w-zg/viewform).

## Payment & Licenses
### What payment methods will be accepted for purchasing a node?​
The nodes will be priced in USDC for both the Whitelist Sale and Public Sale, both on Arbitrum. However, to facilitate payment for users on different chains, the AI Alignment Node Sale will be accepting multiple tokens across multiple networks through a live bridging aggregator that accepts multichain payment including but not limited to BTC, ETH, ARB, SOL, etc. More info [here](https://docs.li.fi/list-chains-bridges-dex-aggregators-solvers).

### How will the node licenses be distributed?​
After the node sale period is completed, node licenses will be distributed as an NFT to the purchase wallet of the user.

### What will I receive from participating in the node sale?​
You will receive a soulbound NFT (ERC-721) which represents your Node License. The NFTs can be minted and transferred to your wallet via claim.0gfoundation.ai after the conclusion of the node sale. You will be able to operate the node after 0G Mainnet is live.

### Will the NFTs be transferable?
The Alignment Node license gives buyers lifetime access. The NFTs will be non-transferable for the first year after the node sale.

## Node Operations
### What are the hardware requirements?​
0G Foundation’s AI Alignment nodes are designed for adoption - they can be run on community member's laptops, desktops, mobiles, or even on cloud instances.
As for device requirements, the configuration needed is very minimal:
- 64MB RAM
- 1 x86 CPU Core @2.1GHz
- 10GB Disk Space
- 10Mbps Internet Connection

### When can I begin operating my node?​
AI Alignment utility will go live in 2025, after 0G Mainnet Launch.

### How many nodes can I purchase?​
The number of purchasable nodes will be capped per tier. Please refer to the [Node Sale Tier documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dgdbrs0LA_mSSYB7cSEWmQPMJvok0FjqAHX-nLxEzs/edit?gid=2031834824#gid=2031834824) for reference.

### How do I run a node? Is it complicated?​

If you prefer not to manage the node yourself, you can delegate to other node operators with just a single click through our explorer, which will be available shortly.

Both Public and Whitelist sale will be available [here](https://node.0gfoundation.ai/) except for Partnered Launchpads, in which case the front end will be on 0G Partners' website.

### What will happen to any unsold node rewards? 
Rewards from unsold nodes will be reallocated to the sold node runners.

### What is the % unlocked at TGE? 
33% of node rewards will be initially claimable on TGE. In order to encourage long term participation in the 0G ecosystem, there will be a penalty based on duration in which a participant chooses to receive this initial reward. The remaining 67% of alignment rewards are linearly unlocked (daily) over 36 months. This penalty mechanism is subject to community vote, further showcasing the "community first approach" of 0G.

### When is KYC required? How is it conducted? 
KYC is required before claiming rewards. It will be provided by a third-party provider. No refund will be offered if the node purchaser does not meet KYC requirements. 

### How many nodes can I purchase? 
Each individual can purchase up to a certain amount of nodes per tier. See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16dgdbrs0LA_mSSYB7cSEWmQPMJvok0FjqAHX-nLxEzs/edit?gid=2031834824#gid=2031834824) for the caps per tier.

### What happened to unsold nodes? 
Unsold alignment node NFT licenses will be burned. The rewards from the unsold nodes will be re-allocated to the sold verified node buyers.
